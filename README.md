# HospitalDataAnalysis
I am doing analysis over the hospital data in this project with python libraries

## List of libraries used:
* numpy
* pandas
* seaborn
* matplotlib


## Reason/inpiration behind this project:
Let's suppose a customer wants to invest in the company but this investor knows very little about Company and needs to understand the business as much as possible before making his investment decision. So, with this project I intend to show/give in-depth insight of the company's performance, revenues and profits based on certain criterias.


## Data sets
* bookings.csv - Details of appointments being booked and type of payment mode used by the user.
* users.csv - Details of the users who are calling to verify their status of their inquiry.
* clinics.csv - Details of account manager, facilitator name, city, country and name of the clinic who approved of the procedure.
* inquiries.csv - Details of all the primary keys to merge all files.
* procedures.csv - Details of procedures and theis categories.
